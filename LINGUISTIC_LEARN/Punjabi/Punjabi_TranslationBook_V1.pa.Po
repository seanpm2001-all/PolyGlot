Punjabi translation book
Punjabi language knowledge of Seanpm2001
Translates: English (en-US) to Punjabi (lt) in the Punjabi script, Romanized with the standard Punjabi romanization method
<!-- Some translations are based on feminine and masculine word definitions, as Punjabi is a gender-based language. !-->
<!-- Due to limitations with Bing Translate on Romanization samples not being present, I unfortunately had to use Google translate !-->
<!-- Google Translate was used, as Bing translate doesn't show gender-specific translations !-->
<!-- Google Translate was used, as Bing translate doesn't support Latin !-->
I used Google Translate, as I didn't want to use Bing Translate right now.
