Spanish translation book
Spanish language knowledge of Seanpm2001
Translates: English (en-US) to Spanish (es-spain) in the Latin script, no romanization needed
Some translations are based on feminine and masculine word definitions, as Spanish is a gender-based language.
<!-- Due to limitations with Bing Translate on Romanization samples not being present, I unfortunately had to use Google translate !-->
Google Translate was used, as Bing translate doesn't show gender-specific translations
