Japanese translation book
Japanese language knowledge of Seanpm2001
Translates: English (en-US) to Japanese (ja-Kana) in the Kana script, along with Hepburn Romanization
Due to limitations with Bing Translate on Hepburn Romanization samples not being present, I unfortunately had to use Google translate
