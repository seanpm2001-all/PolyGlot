Korean (South) translation book
Korean (South) language knowledge of Seanpm2001
Translates: English (en-US) to Korean (South) (ja-SK Hangul) in the SK Hangul script, along with Hepburn Romanization
Due to limitations with Bing Translate on Hepburn Romanization samples not being present, I unfortunately had to use Google translate
