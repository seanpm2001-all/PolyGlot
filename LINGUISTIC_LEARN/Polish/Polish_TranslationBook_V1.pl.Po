Polish language knowledge of Seanpm2001
Translates: English (en-US) to Polish (eo) in the Latin script, no romanization needed
<!-- Some translations are based on feminine and masculine word definitions, as Polish is a gender-based language. !-->
<!-- Due to limitations with Bing Translate on Romanization samples not being present, I unfortunately had to use Google translate !-->
<!-- Google Translate was used, as Bing translate doesn't show gender-specific translations !-->
