French translation book
French language knowledge of Seanpm2001
Translates: English (en-US) to French (fr) in the Latin script, no romanization needed
Some translations are based on feminine and masculine word definitions, as French is a gender-based language.
<!-- Due to limitations with Bing Translate on Romanization samples not being present, I unfortunately had to use Google translate !-->
Google Translate was used, as Bing translate doesn't show gender-specific translations
